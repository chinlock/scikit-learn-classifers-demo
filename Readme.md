# SCIKIT Learn Demo

## Description

This jupyter notebook demostrates how easy it is to use the common` 
classifiers in scikit learni for supervised learning.

It uses the titanic dataset, and tries to build a predictor of who will survive.

The demo is created partly for a quick demo session @ Govtech Data Connect #2 in June 17.

Comments are welcomed.
